INTRODUCTION
============

Klib is a standalone and lightweight C library. Most components are independent
of external libraries, except the standard C library, and independent of each
other. To use a component of this library, you only need to copy one or two
files to your souce code tree without worrying about library dependencies.

Klib strives for efficiency and a small memory footprint. Some components, such
as khash.h, kbtree.h, ksort.h and kvec.h, are among the most efficient
implementations of similar algorithms or data structures, and use less memory
than many others.
